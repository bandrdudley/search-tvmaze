## The React Coding Challenge

Using a npm starter application such as “create-react-app”
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app

Create an interface that has an input that will search the TV Maze API
http://www.tvmaze.com/api
https://api.tvmaze.com/search/shows?q=walking

Then, display the results matching the design provided.
 

## Success is:
The initial page will have a text input and button.
Successfully make the api call
Display the results in a view that is human readable

The time taken should not exceed 4 hours, please stop when you reach the time limit. This isn’t for completeness but to get a sense of coding ability.

 

## Extra:
If time allows feel free to add anything additional that you would like to highlight.
For example:
- Tests
- Interactions to click a show and get a list of episodes
